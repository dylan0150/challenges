A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.

Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.

NB:
Upon reaching 10000000000000009, fails to cast "10000000000000009" to a number, instead casts it to 10000000000000008...?
